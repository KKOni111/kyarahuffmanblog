<p> For this piece, I wanted to redesign the character Bliss from Powerpuff Girls. As a half-black woman myself, I was quite disappointed with the lack of positive representation that came from this character, and I felt like her design as well as her personality was a little questionable for the first Powerpuff girl. So for my redesign, I tried to fix some of the elements of her design that were universally disliked, such as her hairstyle, color palette, and weird body proportions. For the hairstyle, I wanted to give her a fro since in her original hairstyle itâ€™s straight but with a weird bump at the bottom. I also changed the hair color to a more muted blue to match her complexion a little bit more. Since she is supposed to be an older power puff girl, I also decided to redesign her outfit. I created a new outfit for her based on both the original Powerpuff Girl outfit as well as several references from other superheroes I grew up with. I gave her a skort which is more practical for fighting, as well as knee-high boots that I felt would make her look way cooler than the Mary Jane flats she was originally rocking. I also gave her some more accessories to complete her look such as a belt, cooler top, and gloves. Lastly, for the background, I drew a simple render of Townsville, the city where the Power Puff girls live, and wrote POWERPUFF GIRLS on the top of the drawing to make it look like a comic book cover. <p>
