<p style="text-align:center;"> The one product that I would recommend to my viewers/readers is the XPPen Drawing Tablet with Screen Full-Laminated Graphics Drawing Monitor Artist 13.3 Pro Graphics Tablet with Adjustable Stand and 8 Shortcut Keys. I truly believe that this product is beneficial for many kinds of people. For example, digital artists, whether through drawing on a drawing program or making a poster in Photoshop, will find this tablet extremely useful and versatile. On the other hand, traditional artists will also be able to benefit from this purchase due to how simple it is to grasp digital art because of the sleek and modern design of the tablet. Lastly, the price of the drawing tablet ensures that artists will be able to have a high-quality tool to use even while on a budget. The XPPen Drawing tablet 13.3 is a valuable purchase for many reasons. 
There are many things about the XPPen drawing tablet that make it a great option for various digital artists. For one, the pen's design is very innovative and mindful of its audience. The design of the barrel, for example, ensures that the pen will be comfortable to hold while working on an art piece and to avoid cramping of the hand. The pen also comes with pen nibs of a variety of thicknesses to make the pen customizable to the user's preferences. As for the tablet itself, it comes with 2 shortcut keys to make sure that the artist’s workflow goes as smoothly as possible without the hassle of using the mouse to click on different tools or settings within an art program. The quality of the screen itself is also very nice. The protector ensures that the screen is not too slippery to draw on and has a slight grittiness similar to paper. The graphics and colors of the screen are also extremely vivid, ensuring that the piece the artist works on looks as vivid and colorful as possible. 
	Another great aspect of the XPPen drawing tablet is that it is extremely beginner-friendly. All you need to do is plug the two cords into your computer, turn on the tablet, and go to settings to set up the second monitor. Then open your software of choice and draw with your pen and you’re officially ready to draw! This tablet is very easy to use compared to screenless tablets where you have to train yourself to look at the computer and guess where your pen will draw. This makes the XPPen a great choice for those who are just getting into digital art. 
	Perhaps the most appealing aspect of the XPPpen Drawing Tablet is its extremely competitive price. For context, there are screen tablets that will go up to 1000 dollars, and that’s without the computer needed to set up the screen tablet. However, for a mere 200 dollars, you can get not only the XPPen but also a pen case and replacement nibs. I believe that it is important to not only have high-quality art materials but to also not have to sacrifice a huge chunk of money just to pursue your passions. 
	Overall, the XPPen tablet is a great purchase in my opinion. The design of both the pen and the tablet itself is made for artists to ensure that they have the best experience possible. The simple, sleek design combined with the easy setup makes the tablet a great option for those who are new to digital art and don’t want to have to struggle with learning how to use a new tool. The price of the tablet makes it a great option for artists who are on a budget, college students, or those who simply don’t want to have to fork up multiple paychecks just to indulge in something they enjoy. An XPen table is an all-around great art material to add to any artist’s collection.
